		<h3> 1:WWW and html </h3>
		
		<p>What are the most essential technologies that made the World Wide Web such a success?<br>
		conect the hole world<br></p>
		<br>
		<p>How are resources (html pages, images, etc) addressed in the web?<br>
		they have an URL<br></p>
		<br>
		<p>What are the general components of a url?<br>
		A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of URI (Universal Resource Identifier). A URL normally locates an existing resource on the Internet. A URL is used when a web client makes a request to a server for a resource.<br>
		
		<h3>Web Server</h3>
		
		<p>What is a Web Server<br>
		It is a sever that uses HTTP to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.<br>
		<br></p>
		<p>What does the web server do?<br>
		For example, to produce the final webpages you see in the browser, the application server might fill an HTML template with contents from a database. Sites like MDN or Wikipedia have many thousands of webpages, but they aren't real HTML documents, only a few HTML templates and a giant database. This setup makes it easier and quicker to maintain and deliver the content.<br>
		<br></p>
		<p>How can content be stored on a web server?<br>
		So, you can have what is really a text file that has the html code stored on it. The text file is saved to the server, then when its called to a web browser, it renders in a way that looks good. Or, at least looks how the developer wanted it to.
		<br></p>
		<p>How is content in webpages described?<br>
		Web content is dominated by the "page" concept, its beginnings in an academic setting, and in a setting dominated by type-written pages, the idea of the web was to link directly from one academic paper to another academic paper.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>WEB CLIENT</h3>
		
		<p>What is the html head element?<br>
		It's the element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed after the tag and for the tag.<br>
		<br></p>
		<p>What does that mean?<br>
		is a declaration,it stays before the tag.<br>
		<br></p>
		<p>What are the two top most elements within the html element?<br>
		CSS and Java<br>
		<br></p>
		<p>How to emphasize a text and how is it displayed in the browser<br>
		The text-emphasis CSS property is a shorthand property for setting text -emphasis-style and text-emphasis-color in one declaration. This property will apply the specified emphasis mark to each character of the element's text, except separator characters, like spaces, and control characters.<br>
		<br></p>
		<p>How to mark up important text and how is it displayed in the browser?<br>
		An important point to cover before I start discussing text, though, is that of space, specifically the space between words. When writing HTML, the source document will contain what is termed �white space� � the characters in the file that serve to separate text. An actual space character, as you would get when you hit the Spacebar on the keyboard is the most common, but there are others such as the Tab character and the marker between two separate lines in a document (called a carriage return or new line).<br>
